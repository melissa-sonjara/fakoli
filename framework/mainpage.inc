 * @section intro Introduction
 * 
 * Fakoli is a lightweight rapid application development framework, designed from the core to facilitate the
 * development of high quality data intensive applications in today's accelerated web timescale. Fakoli is 
 * built around the principles of lightweight design.
 * 
 * Fakoli is an entity-based framework. Developers define a data model for their application by deriving
 * @see DataItem based classes that represent database tables and the relations between them. These classes
 * can then be used to navigate the data model and display forms and data in a variety of ways.
