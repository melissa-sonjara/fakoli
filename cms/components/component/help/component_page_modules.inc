<h2>Mapping Component Page Modules</h2>
<p>Sometimes you will want to display a module in the page template
whenever a component page is displayed. To do so, put in the name of
the position within the template and the sort order in the module's
row within this table. The module will be displayed for this component
page whenever there is a matching position within the assigned template.</p>
