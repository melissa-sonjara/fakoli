/**
 * Panel provides a reloadable panel tied to an action handler.
 * A reload() method is automatically attached to the panel's DOM
 * and can be called from Javascript to refresh the panel contents
 * via an asynchronous request (i.e. without refreshing the page).
 * Additionally the panel is filled by default using the ComponentManager's
 * local action dispatch mechanism. Panels can be used to easily provide
 * updatable content areas without having to re-implement too much plumbing.
