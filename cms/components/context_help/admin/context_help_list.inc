/*
 * 
 * Title:  context_help_list.php
 * 
 * Description: Displays a list of the features for which
 * context help can be written.
 * 
 * 1) Get all the valid files from the datamodel directory
 * 
 * 2) Read each file line by line to gather the names of 
 * each class. Automatically eliminate classes we know are
 * irrelevant for help: join classes and status forms. Check
 * for a comment on the class declaration line, "// no help"
 * and don't include those classes
 * 
 * 3) Given an array of class names, create an instance of
 * each class to get the following:
 * 
 * a) the fields array for the list of fields for which
 * help can be provided
 * 
 * b) the "additionalFields" array which provides the list 
 * of supplemental or pseudo fields associated with a 
 * feature/script for which help can be created.
 * 
 * c) the prettified class name which we want to display
 * to the user when presenting classes for which help
 * can be defined
 * 
 * 4) Retrieve from the db, all the defined help, grouped
 * by class name. Match the classes for which help is 
 * available with the classes array. If help is found,
 * match the help field with the field in the array for
 * that class.
 * 
 * 5) Display a table with the list of classes, fields
 * in the class and a checkbox to indicate if a help
 * record exists for that class/field. The table
 * enables the user to click on a class/field to
 * edit help or create a help record.
