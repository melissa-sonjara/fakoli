<h2>Blog Form</h2>
<p>The <i>Blog</i> Form allows you to create a new blog or edit an existing blog. 
Using the HTML editor, you can enter the blog content with HTML formatting. The 
blog teaser is meant to provide your audience with just enough information to 
spark their interest in reading the blog. It should be only about one or two 
sentences.</p>
