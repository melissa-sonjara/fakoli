<h2>Scheduled Task Execution Logs</h2>
<p>This report shows an entry for each time the scheduled task has been run.
The returned status is listed, and you can view the full log generated by the
task via the <b>Show Log</b> button on each line. By default the logs for runs
in the current month are shown. The date filter lets you see logs from earlier
time periods.</p>
